In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes COVID-19 coronaviral disease."),
    "FAQAnswer2" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("COVID-19 is the most recently discovered infectious disease caused by the coronavirus. This new virus and this new disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China in December 2019."),
    "FAQAnswer3" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry cough. Some patients may experience pain, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people are infected but do not develop any symptoms and do not feel sick. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. About 1 in 6 people who get COVID-19 become seriously ill and develop breathing difficulties. The elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."),
    "FAQAnswer4" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("People can get COVID-19 from other people who have the virus. The disease can be spread from person to person by small droplets from the nose or mouth that are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or expires. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then get COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also get COVID-19 if they breathe in the droplets from a person with COVID-19 who is coughing or breathing out the droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than one metre away from a sick person. WHO is evaluating ongoing research on the modes of spread of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated results."),
    "FAQAnswer5" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air."),
    "FAQAnswer6" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("The disease is spread mainly by respiratory droplets expelled by a coughing person. The risk of catching COVID-19 from a person with no symptoms is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 have only mild symptoms. This is especially true in the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to get COVID-19 from a person who, for example, has only a mild cough and does not feel sick.  WHO is evaluating ongoing research on the transmission period of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated results."),
    "FAQAnswer7" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("The risk of contracting COVID-19 from the stool of an infected person appears to be low. Although initial investigations suggest that the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a major feature of the epidemic. WHO is evaluating ongoing research on the modes of spread of COVID-19 and will continue to share new findings. But because it is a risk, it is an additional reason to wash your hands regularly, after using the toilet and before eating."),
